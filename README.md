# PROJET-DEEP-LEARNING

This is a problem of classifying facial images. The classification criteria are implicitly defined by the labels of the training set.

To evaluate the results, it is necessary to provide the predictions for the test set as a text file with the same number of lines as the test set. It is important to maintain the order of the images in the list of the test set.

To tackle this problem, I began by preparing the data through data cleaning and data augmentation, in order to improve the algorithm's performance. Next, I developed a deep learning algorithm using CNN networks to extract features from the images and classify them.

Tools used: Python and PyTorch.
